	<p> Deciphering the nuances that distinguish, say, a 1970 Rolex Submariner from a 1980 version can require the sharp eye of a forensic analyst and the patience of a research librarian. Indeed, Rolex experts tend toward detailed taxonomies of minuscule modifications, and Rolex does indeed introduce these incremental annual updates to the point where many modifications seem more mythical than material. People new to Rolex face mountains of such information, and that can make getting to know the brand intimidating and confusing.</p>

	<p> Titan is the first study of John D. Rockefeller, Sr., to be based on the voluminous company and family records collected by the Rockefellers and their charitable foundations since Allan Nevins published his massive John D. Rockefeller: The Heroic Age of American Industry (2 vols., 1940; revised under the title Study in Power: John D. Rockefeller, Industrialist and Philanthropist, 1953). Other than material dealing with family matters that was not yet open to the public in the 1940’s, Chernow uses little data that was unavailable to Nevins. Chernow, however, is much more impartial in his evaluation of Rockefeller’s behavior. Nevins, attempting to correct factual misstatements in critical studies of Rockefeller published during the Progressive and New Deal years, tended to defend Rockefeller’s business practices. Chernow is less willing to accept Rockefeller’s rationalizations concerning his business behavior. Where most biographers portray Rockefeller as either essentially good or essentially evil, Chernow depicts him as both. Chernow’s carefully balanced narrative makes Titan the best account of Rockefeller’s life and career available.</p>
